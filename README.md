Scenario Week 3
A local business has been doing payroll manually and wants to automate the process. You are going to provide a proof of concept to demonstrate how data will be entered and payroll calculated. The user will enter an employee name, hours worked, hourly rate, and income tax rate. The program will calculate the income taxes and net pay. After all data is entered, employee name, hours worked, hourly rate, gross pay, income tax rate, income taxes, and net pay will be displayed. When the user enters “End” for the employee name, the loop will terminate and the program will display the total number of employees, total hours worked, total gross pay, total income taxes, and total net pay for all employees.


Complete the following in Practice Labs:
Create a loop that will get user input by calling various functions until terminated by the user typing “End.”
Create a function that will input and return the employee's name and is called inside the loop.
Create a function that will input and return total hours and is called inside the loop.
Create a function that will input and return the hourly rate and is called inside the loop.
Create a function that will input and return the income tax rate and is called inside the loop.
Create a function that will take total hours, hourly rate, and tax rate as parameters, which will then calculate and return the income tax and net pay—it should also be called inside the loop.
Create a function that will display employee name, total hours, hourly rate, income tax rate, income tax, and net pay, and is called inside the loop.
Create a function that will display total number of employees, total hours, total tax, and total net pay.
Submit the Python source code file and a Word document that contains a screenshot of input and display for one employee and a screenshot of the display of totals. A minimum of five employees must be entered to receive full credit. Include a 1–2 sentence reflection on the successes and challenges you had with this assignment.
Ensure all functionality is working correctly and code is written efficiently. For purposes of this assignment, writing code efficiently is defined as:
Using correct naming conventions for all variables and objects.
Using correct naming conventions for functions and methods.
Using built-in functions whenever possible.  
Using the fewest lines of code needed to return multiple values from functions.
Using the fewest lines of code needed to complete the functionality defined.

Scenario Week 5
Create a new function that will input and return the from date and to date for the hours worked and is called inside the loop.  This should be the first function called.  Dates must be in the format mm/dd/yyyy.
Store the from date, to date, employee name, total hours, hourly rate and income tax rate in a list object. Note: multiple list objects may be needed to complete this functionality
After the user terminates the loop, call a function that will:
Read through the list(s) and for each employee calculate the income tax and net pay.  
Display the from date, to date, employee name, hours worked, hourly rate, gross pay, income tax rate, income taxes and net pay for the employee
Increment the total number of employees, total hours, total tax, total net pay and store the values in a dictionary object.
Modify the function that displays totals to read the data from the dictionary object and then display the totals.




This is a work in progress. The code is functional but I will be adding more to it as the course progresses. The paragraph above describes what is required of this code and how it functions.
